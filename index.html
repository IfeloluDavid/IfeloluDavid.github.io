	 		<h3>Overview of Stuxnet</h3>
	 		Stuxnet is a sophisticated worm designed to target only specific Siemens SCADA (industrial control)
systems.
It makes use of an unprecedented four 0-day vulnerabilities- attacks that make use of a security
vulnerability in an application, before the vulnerability is known to the application’s developers.
It also uses rootkits - advanced techniques to hide itself from users and anti-malware software -
on both Windows and the control computers it targets. It employs two stolen digital certificates to
sign its drivers, and its creators needed a large amount of knowledge of its targeted systems. See
Figure 1 for an overview.
It was discovered in June 2010, but an early version appeared a year earlier. It is widely
suspected of targeting Iran’s uranium enrichment program, since it is rather specific about what it
attacks, and this matches the Iranian Natanz enrichment plant.
One indication that Stuxnet targeted Iran’s nuclear program is that it only targets facilities that
have a certain specific physical layout. The layout of the centrifuges in a facility such as Natanz is
called a cascade, and describes how the centrifuges are piped together; this is done in stages, and
the centrifuges within one stage are piped in parallel.
Iranian President Ahmadinejad visited Natanz on April 8, 2008, and photos of the visit were
published on his website as a photo-op. In one of the photos (Figure 2) is what appears to be a
monitor showing the structure of a so-called IR-1 (for Iran-1 centrifuge) cascade. This structure,
giving the number of centrifuges in each stage, matches the Stuxnet code exactly.
Iran’s nuclear program launched in the 1950s with the Shah of Iran obtaining non weaponsrelated assistance from the United States’ “Atoms for Peace” program. The program’s inception
was delayed because of the 1979 revolution and after that because of the Iran-Iraq war. However,
Iran’s new leaders were interested in continuing the nuclear program and started getting help from
other countries to further it.
In 2002, an Iranian opposition group publicly revealed two undeclared nuclear facilities, resulting
in Iran admitting to having constructed facilities for fuel enrichment and heavy water production,
ostensibly for use in research reactors. Iran suspended its plans in 2003 but resumed them in 2006
and insists that it has the right to establish its own uranium enrichment program.
Iran maintains that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful. However, the IAEA (International
Atomic Energy Agency) insists that Iran does not comply with the safeguard program it has agreed
to, resulting in various sanctions against Iran by the UN Security Council [9]. It is widely believed
that Iran is in fact working toward producing nuclear weapons.Assuming that Stuxnet was intended to damage this suspected nuclear weapons program, it
was somewhat effective: it may have destroyed 1,000 centrifuges at Natanz, about 11% of the total
number installed at the time. Also, Iran doesn’t have an unlimited number of centrifuges, and
the ones they do have tend to fail relatively often, so such a decrease is significant, albeit not immediately fatal to the program. In addition, Stuxnet decreased production of enriched uranium
and likely sowed chaos within the Iranian nuclear program.
Israel and the U.S. are the leading suspects as Stuxnet’s creators. Neither are friends of Iran’s
current leadership (to put it mildly) and both, especially Israel, fear a nuclear-armed Iran.
Israel has said that cyberwarfare is an important part of its defense strategy, and has a military
intelligence unit dedicated to it, according to Wikipedia. Furthermore, Israeli officials are said to
have responded with “wide smiles” when they were asked in 2010 whether Israel created Stuxnet [5].
Furthermore, a video celebrating the operational successes of the head of the Israeli Defence
Forces’ Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi, shown at his retirement party, showed Stuxnet as being
among them, according to the Daily Telegraph [15].
Before Stuxnet had been discovered, according to Wikipedia, “John Bumgarner, a former intelligence officer and member of the United States Cyber-Consequences Unit (US-CCU)” had published
an article describing a Stuxnet-like attack on centrifuges, and claimed that such attacks against
nations enriching uranium in violation of international treaties are legitimate. This, combined with
some US officials’ not-quite-denials of involvement, raise suspicions that the US participated in
Stuxnet’s creation, despite official denials.

	 		<h3>Operation of Stuxnet</h3>
	 		One thing that differentiates Stuxnet from more run-of-the-mill malicious software is that its creators have incorporated lots of capabilities into it. These range from exploiting multiple zero-day
vulnerabilities, modifying system libraries, attacking Step7 installations (Siemens’ SCADA control
software) and running an RPC server, to installing signed drivers on Windows operating systems.
Figure 3 shows an overview of multiple components which are present in the malware. This section
describes these components and their various purposes.
Stuxnet spreads via several vectors, no doubt selected to ultimately allow it to infect the PLCs
it targets. It is capable of auto-updating, so that it can update old versions of itself to newer
versions available on a local network. It communicates with command and control servers to
provide information on its spread to its creators and also provide another way for it to be updated.
It conceals its presence and the source of its destructive effects from plant personnel, who may be
totally unaware that it is the cause of unexplained problems.
